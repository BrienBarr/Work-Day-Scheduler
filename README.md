# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

In this homework assignment, I was tasked to create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day to manage his/her time effectively. This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

## Acceptance Criteria

I was told to meet the following acceptance criteria.

```
1.When the planner is opened, the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar.
1.When the user scrolls down, he/she is presented with time blocks for standard business hours.
1.When the time blocks are viewed for that day, each time block is color-coded to show if it is
in the past, present, or future based on the current hour
1.When the user clicks into a time block, he/she can enter an event
1.When the save button is clicked for a time block, the text for the event for that time block is
saved into local storage
1.When the planner is refreshed, the save events persist
```

## Mock-Up
